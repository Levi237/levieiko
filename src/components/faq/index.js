            <h2>Should I code my website or use a builder/generator like Shopify?</h2>
            <p>
              If you have to integrate with a lot of third-party technologies or handles payments, it is best to use a builder/generator that can handle future updates better and offer a higher level of e-commerce needs.
              <br/>
              <small>Example: <a href="https://momomuscle.co">MomoMuscle.co</a></small>
              <br/><br/>
              If you want a website that looks super cool and you don't want to pay monthly fees, a coded website gives you the freedom to be creative.  
              I usually use Firebase for hosting since it is free to small busineses and only starts charging when you gain a lot of traffic.
              It also offers a free SSL, that's nice too.
              <br/>

            <h2>What is an SSL certificate?</h2>
            <div>
              <p style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>
                Ever see this? üëâ 
              </p>
              <p>
                It's the <i>s</i> in "https", meaning <i>Secure</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer.
                An SSL Certificate authenticates you as a legitimate domaine to bypass these firewalls and ensure your users that your site is safe.

            <h2>This is a lot to process, where do I start?</h2>
            <p>
              I recommend starting with your minimum viable product (MVP).
              The sooner you start generating revenue the sooner you can invest in yourself!

            <h2>What is a Mobile-first design?</h2>
            <p>
              Essentially we are building a website intended to the best user experience on their mobile device.
              More and more people are using their phones to surf the web.  
              A mobile-first website doesn't have the barrier of a download requirement, giving people more of an opportunity to view your brand.

            <h2>Mobile-first Website -OR- APP?</h2>
            <p>
              It really depends on the complexity.  
              Apps sound glamorous but there are a few things to consider.  
              Apps are limited on which devices you can view them.  
              Apps need to be downloaded and take up space on peoples phones.
              <br/>
              Most businesses can create the same experience with a mobile-first designed website with added versatility.
