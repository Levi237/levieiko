            <h2>What is a Mobile-first design?</h2>
            <p>
              Essentially we are building a website intended to the best user experience on their mobile device.
              More and more people are using their phones to surf the web.  
              A mobile-first website doesn't have the barrier of a download requirement, giving people more of an opportunity to view your brand.

            <h2>Mobile-first Website -OR- APP?</h2>
            <p>
              It really depends on the complexity.  
              Apps sound glamorous but there are a few things to consider.  
              Apps are limited on which devices you can view them.  
              Apps need to be downloaded and take up space on peoples phones.
              <br/>
              Most businesses can create the same experience with a mobile-first designed website with added versatility.
