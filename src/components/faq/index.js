            <h2>Should I code my website or use a builder/generator like Shopify?</h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to legal stuff and e-commerce, I would say why re-invent the wheel?  If you're a small business, let's do it through Shopify or WordPress!
              Sometimes you need to integrate third party technologies.  WordPress could have a plugin that will save you time and money in development.

            <h2>This is a lot to process, where do I start?</h2>
            <p>
              I recommend starting with your minimum viable product (MVP).
              The sooner you start generating revenue the sooner you can invest in yourself!

            <h2>What is a Mobile-first design?</h2>
            <p>
              Essentially we are building a website intended to the best user experience on their mobile device.
              More and more people are using their phones to surf the web.  
              A mobile-first website doesn't have the barrier of a download requirement, giving people more of an opportunity to view your brand.

            <h2>Mobile-first Website -OR- APP?</h2>
            <p>
              It really depends on the complexity.  
              Apps sound glamorous but there are a few things to consider.  
              Apps are limited on which devices you can view them.  
              Apps need to be downloaded and take up space on peoples phones.
              <br/>
              Most businesses can create the same experience with a mobile-first designed website with added versatility.
